## Installation

1. Download the repo as a zip file
- Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the zip file
- Delete Readme.md file
- Delete the zip file after extracting
3. Go to profile directory of Zen Browser
- Or open Zen Browser and go to `about:profiles`
- Search for "Root directory" in the profile you're using
- On macOS there should be a button "Show in Finder" / for other OS there should be a similar button, just the text can be different
- After clicking the button, you will be taken to the profile directory
4. Go to `chrome` folder directory
- If there is no `chrome` folder, create one
- Replace that folder with the `chrome` folder from the extracted zip file
5. Restart Zen Browser
- if nothing changes, go to `about:config` and search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`
- if still nothing changes, i don't know how to help you :)
